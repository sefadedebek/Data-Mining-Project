# Data Mining Project: Estimation and Comperative Performance Analysis of Three Classification Algorithms on Stock and Cryptocurrency Data

In this project, classification algorithms such as Random Forest, KNN and Logistic Regression are applied.


Market forecasting in stock markets and cryptocurrencies is a very important element in the financial market. It is important to successfully forecast the stock market to get maximum profit. In this article, classification algorithms such as Random Forest, KNN and Logistic Regression are applied. We evaluate algorithms by finding performance measures such as accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-score. Our goal is to predict and compare future stock and cryptocurrency performances.
